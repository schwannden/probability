# Joint Gaussion

**Definition** We say $$\mathbb{X_1}, ..., \mathbb{X_n}$$ are said to be **jointly Gaussian**, or have **multivariate normal distribution** if the joint moment generating function of $$\bar{\mathbb{X}}$$ has the following form:
$$M_{\bar{\mathbb{X}}}(\bar{t}) = e^{\bar{t}^{\ T}\mu} e^{\bar{t}^{\ T}A\bar{t}}$$
Where $$A$$ is symmetric positive semidefinite matrix.
